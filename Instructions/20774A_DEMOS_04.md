## Demo 1: Preprocessing data using Machine Learning

### Scenario

In this demonstration, you will see how to:
-	Use the Summarize module to identify issues with imported raw data.
-	Clean the import to remove rows with missing data.
-	Remove outliers from the imported data.


### Preparation

This demo requires the Azure SQL Database that you created in Lab 3. In addition, before running this demo, you must complete the following steps:
1.	On the **20774A-LON-DEV** virtual machine, ensure that you are logged on as **ADATUM\AdatumAdmin**.
2.	On the Start menu, start to type **Internet Explorer**, and then click **Internet Explorer**.
3.	In Internet Explorer, in the address bar, type **https://studio.azureml.net/**.
4.	On the **Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio** page, click **Sign In**. 
5.	If you are prompted for credentials, use the details of the Microsoft account that you created for this course.
6.	Ensure that **EXPERIMENTS** is selected in the navigation pane, then click **+ NEW**.
7.	Click **Blank Experiment**.
8.	In the **Search experiment items** box, type **Import**, and then from the module list, drag **Import Data** on to the experiment canvas.
9.	In the right-hand **Properties** pane, in the **Data source** list, select **Azure SQL Database**.
10.	In the **Database server name** box, type the following (replacing **\<your db servername\>** with the name of your database server from Lab 3):

    **\<your db servername\>.database.windows.net**
11.	In the **Database name** box, type **WideWorldImporters-Standard**.
12.	In the **User name** box, type **dbadmin**.
13.	In the **Password** box, type **Pa55w.rd**.
14.	In the **Database query** box, type the following command to use a subset of the total data:
    ```SQL
    SELECT * From [20774A].[CustomerTransactions]
    ```
15.	Select **Use cached results**.
16.	Click **SAVE AS** at the bottom of the page.
17.	In the **EXPERIMENT NAME** box, type **Preprocessing Demo**, and click **OK** (tick).

### Use the Summarize module to identify issues with imported raw data

1.	In Machine Learning Studio, ensure that the **Preprocessing Demo** experiment is open, and that **EXPERIMENTS** is selected in the navigation pane.
2.	In the **Search experiment items** box, type **Summarize**, and then from the module list, drag **Summarize Data** on to the right-hand side of the experiment canvas.
3.	Connect the **Import Data** module to the input port of the **Summarize Data** module. 
4.	Run the experiment, by clicking **RUN** at the bottom of the page.
5.	When the experiment has run successfully, right-click the output port of the **Summarize Data** module, and then click **Visualize**.
6.	Point out that the **Summarize Data** module has transposed the columns from the raw data into rows, and has generated summary statistics from the 97,547 rows in the original data; verify that there are now five rows and 23 columns.
7.	Close the visualization by clicking the **x** at the top-right of the window.

### Clean the import to remove rows with missing data

1.	In the **Search experiment items** box, type **Clean**, and then from the module list, drag **Clean Missing Data** on to the experiment canvas.
2.	Connect the input port of the **Clean Missing Data** module to the output port of the **Import Data** module.
3.	Click the **Clean Missing Data** module, and in the **Properties** pane, under **Cleaning mode**, click **Remove entire row**.
4.	Run the experiment, by clicking **RUN** at the bottom of the page.
5.	Click the left-hand output port of the **Clean Missing Data** module, and then click **Visualize**. 
6.	Point out that the dataset now contains five columns and 97,147 rows; all the rows that had missing data (400 rows) have been removed.
7.	Close the visualization by clicking the **x** at the top-right of the window.

### Remove outliers from the imported data

1.	Right-click the output port of the **Summarize Data** module, and then click **Visualize**.
2.	Point out that the **OutstandingBalance** field shows a **Max** value of **$28,280**; for this demonstration, you are going to assume that any value over $25,000 is erroneous, because company policy forbids customers from owing more than this amount.
3.	Close the visualization by clicking the **x** at the top-right of the window.
4.	In the **Search experiment** items box, type **Clip**, and then from the module list, drag **Clip Values** on to the experiment canvas.
5.	Connect the input port of the **Clip Values** module to the output port of the **Import Data** module.
6.	Click **Clip Values**, and in the **Properties** pane, click **Launch column selector**.
7.	In the **Select Columns** dialog box, change the **Include** option from column type to **column names**, and in the box, select **OutstandingBalance**, then click the **tick**.
8.	In the Properties pane, set the following values:
    -	Set of thresholds: **ClipPeaks**
    -	Upper threshold: **Constant**
    -	Constant value for upper threshold: **25000**
    -	Upper substitute value: **Mean**
9.	Run the experiment, by clicking **RUN** at the bottom of the page.
10.	When the experiment has finished running, all modules will show a green check mark to indicate that they have successfully finished.
11.	When the experiment has run successfully, right-click the output port of the **Clip Values** module, and then click **Visualize**.
12.	Click the **OutstandingBalance** column.
13.	Point out that, in the **Statistics** pane, **OutstandingBalance** now ranges from 0 to 25000, so all values above 25000 have been replaced, based on the mean of the dataset.
14.	Close the visualization by clicking the **x** at the top-right of the window.
