    ```
    hadoop jar /usr/hdp/current/hadoop-mapreduce-client/hadoop-mapreduce-examples.jar wordcount /example/data/gutenberg/ulysses.txt /example/results 
    ```
8.	Point out that this command runs a MapReduce job to process a text file (**ulysses.txt**) and store the results in the **/example/results** folder.
9.	When the MapReduce job has completed, type the following command, and then press Enter:
    ```
    hdfs dfs -ls /example/results 
    ```
10.	Point out that a file named **part-r-00000** has been created in the **results** folder.
11.	Type the following command, and then press Enter: 
    ```
