## Demo 1: Using Join to merge data

### Scenario

In this demonstration, you will see how to:
-  Create a transaction dataset by importing from Azure SQL Database.
-  Upload a date dataset from a flat file.
-  Add the second dataset to an experiment.
-  Join the transaction and date datasets.

### Preparation

**IMPORTANT**. Recent changes to Azure SQL Database are incompatible with the version of SQL Server Management Studio and tools such as sqlpackage installed on the **20774A-LON-DEV** virtual machine. Before commencing this exercise, login in to the **20774A-LON-DEV** virtual machine as **ADATUM\AdatumAdmin**, open the web browser, move to the URL **https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms**, and then download and install the latest general availability build of SQL Server Management Studio.

Before running this demo, you must complete the following steps:
1.  On the **20774A-LON-DEV** virtual machine, ensure that you are logged on as **ADATUM\AdatumAdmin**.
2.  In Internet Explorer, browse to the Azure portal and sign in with your Azure account.
3.  Create a new SQL Database with the following settings:
    -  **Database name**: WideWorldImporters-Standard
    -  **Resource group (Create new)**: \<*yourname*\>rg
    -  **Select source**: Blank database
    -  **Server**:
        -  **Server name**: \<*yourname\>\<date*\>srv
        -  **Server admin login**: dbadmin
        -  **Password**: Pa55w.rd
        -  **Confirm password**: Pa55w.rd
        -  **Location**: your local region
    -  **Pricing tier**: Standard S0: 10 DTUs, 250 GB
4.  Wait for the successful deployment message.
5.  On the database blade, change the Firewall settings to add your current client IP address to the list of allowed IP addresses.
6.  Start a command prompt with administrative rights.
7.  Change to the **C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SQL Server\140\DAC\Bin** folder.
8.  In the **Command Prompt** window, type the following command (replacing <your db servername> with the name of your database server), and then press Enter:
    ````dos
    SqlPackage.exe /a:import /tcs:"Data Source=<your db servername>.database.windows.net;Initial Catalog=WideWorldImporters-Standard;User Id=dbadmin;Password=Pa55w.rd" /sf:E:\Demofiles\Mod05\WideWorldImporters-Standard.bacpac /p:DatabaseEdition=Standard /p:DatabaseServiceObjective=S0
    ````
    > **Note**: The above command can be copied from **E:\\Demofiles\\Mod05\\SqlPackageCmd.txt**.
9.  The database can take 5-10 minutes to import, when the import completes successfully, close the command prompt.
10. Close the command prompt.
11. In the Azure Portal, on the **WideWorldImporters-Standard** blade, on the **Overview** pane, click **Query editor (preview)**.
12. On the **Query editor (preview)** blade, enter the following details, and then click **OK**:

    ````SQL
    CREATE SCHEMA [20774A] AUTHORIZATION db_owner;
    GO
    EXECUTE sp_addextendedproperty @name = N'Description', 
    @value = N'Schema for AzureML data import.', @level0type = N'SCHEMA', @level0name = N'20774A';

## Demo 2: Using count-based featurization

### Scenario

In this demonstration, you will see how to:
-  Use an example counting transformation.

### Preparation

Before running this demo, you must complete the following steps:
1.  On the **20774A-LON-DEV** virtual machine, in Internet Explorer, in the address bar, type **https://studio.azureml.net/**.
2.  On the **Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio** page, click **Sign In**. 
3.  If you are prompted for credentials, use the details of the Microsoft account that you created for this course.
4.  In Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio, click **EXPERIMENTS**, click the **+ NEW** button in the lower left-hand corner of the screen.
5.  In the **Search experiments templates** box, type **count**, position the cursor on **Learning with Counts: Binary classification with NYC taxi data**, and then click **OPEN IN STUDIO**.
6.  Wait for the experiment to load, and then click **Run**.
7.  Wait for the experiment to finish; note that this might take 10-15 minutes.

### Work through an example counting transformation

1.  Start by pointing out that, to save time, you have already loaded and run an experiment in Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio.
2.  In Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio, in the **Learning with Counts: Binary classification with NYC Taxi Data** experiment, click the **Build Counting Transform** module.
3.  In the **Properties** pane, point out that the label, or target column, is called **tipped**; this data identifies whether the taxi driver received a tip or not.
4.  In the **Properties** pane, under **Select columns to count**, click **Launch column selector**.
5.  In the **Select columns** dialog box, point out that the columns that are contributing towards the count are listed on the right-hand side.
6.  Close the **Select columns** dialog box.
7.  Click the **Modify Count Table Parameters** module.
8.  In the **Properties** pane, point out that no scale has been added; the **Laplacian noise scale** is set to **0**. 
9.  Point to the two **Apply Transformation** tasks; explain that these tasks apply the previously configured counting transformation to both the taxi and fare datasets—one using the count table with the fare data, and the other using the taxi data.
10. Point to the **Two-Class Logistic Regression** module; this is used to identify whether or not a tip was given. The model is trained using the **Train Model** task, and then it is scored using the **Score Model** task.
11. Point to the **Evaluate Model** module. Explain that the efficiency of the model can be determined by using Evaluate Model.
12. Click the **Evaluate Model** output, and then click **Visualize**.
13. Explain that, in the **Receiver Operating Curve (ROC)**, the closer the curve is found to the top left-hand corner, the more successful the model. In this case, you see that the curve is found high up in the left-hand corner. As a first step, the model would appear to be a successful one. However, you need to look more closely at the actual data:
    -  The **Accuracy** score is **0.969**. This shows the ratio of correctly predicted observations. Intuitively, this is a high score.
    -  **Precision** looks at the rate of correct positive observations. Here, the precision shows a high number of correct positive observations.
    -  **Recall** is the ratio of correctly predicted positive events. It is the ratio that was correctly predicted out of the total predictions.
    -  **F1 Score** is the weighted average of Precision and Recall—its score takes both false positives and false negatives into account.
14. Although the scores are good, you would need to review data again—to look for class distributions, and to bear in mind the cost of false positives and false negatives.
15. Close the visualization by clicking the x at the top-right of the window.

>**Note:** In this demo, you have shown a Count Featurizer from the Azure Machine Learning Studio Gallery, which uses the NYC Taxi rides dataset. The objective was to use trip and fare data to work out which trips are most likely to result in tips.

>The challenge is that the data has a lot of features; all trips are all made to, and from, a large variety of destinations—and there’s timing, amount of fare, and tip amount to take into account.
